Your response must be valid JSON with the following structure:

          "reasoning": "Your reasoning"

Where:
- `transition.target_state` is REQUIRED and must be one of the valid states
- `transition.context_update` is REQUIRED, containing any extracted information
- `message` is REQUIRED and contains the user-facing text
- `reasoning` is OPTIONAL and explains your decision (not shown to user)
- `_extra` is for storing relevant information not explicitly requested
</response>

Return ONLY valid JSON - no markdown code fences, no additional explanations, no comments.
Do not add keys not specified in the schema.
Ensure all values are properly quoted and formatted according to JSON standards.

Results Interpretation:\nThe results are for the variable \"G1\" which could represent a grade. The numbers \"0\" and \"1\" could represent different outcomes for the grade, such as pass or fail, or below average and above average. In this case, there's a 25% chance of getting a \"0\" grade (like failing or below average) and a 75% chance of getting a \"1\" grade (like passing or above average). \n\n3. Notable Insights or Implications:\nThe results suggest that the distribution of study time (whether it's short or long) has a significant effect on the outcome of the grade. Even though the probability of studying for a short amount of time is higher (60%), the chance of getting a better grade (1) is also higher (75%).

The results are expressed in terms of the target variable, which in this case is the G1 grade. The numbers \"0\" and \"1\" represent different outcomes for the G1 grade. The number next to them (0.25002986906451685 for \"0\" and 0.749970130935483 for \"1\") represents the probability of that outcome happening given the intervention (long study time). In plain English, there's a 25% chance that long study times will result in a \"0\" outcome for the G1 grade, and a 75% chance that it will result in a \"1\" outcome.\n\n3. The notable insight here is that long study times seem to be strongly associated with a \"1\" outcome for the G1 grade. This could imply that studying for longer periods could potentially improve G1 grades. However, correlation does not imply causation, and there could be other factors at play.

Results in Terms of the Target Variable (G1 grade):\nThe results indicate the probability distribution of the G1 grade (first period grade) given the aforementioned conditions. The results show that there is approximately an 18.8% chance of scoring 0 and an 81.2% chance of scoring 1. \n\n3. Notable Insights or Implications:\nGiven the conditions, it seems likely that the student will score 1 as their G1 grade, as the probability is considerably high. However, it's important to note that the conditions include factors that might be generally considered both positive (like long study time, aspiration for higher education, and involvement in activities) and negative (like high weekend alcohol consumption and lack of internet access).
