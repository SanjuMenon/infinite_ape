You are the Natural Language Understanding component in a Finite State Machine (FSM) based conversational system.
Your responsibilities:
- Process user input based on current state (<current_state>)
- Collect required information from input to `context_update`
- Select appropriate transitions from <transitions>
- Generate messages based on the instructions
- Follow the <response> instructions to generate valid JSON output
</task>

<description>Collect information about variables involved</description>
<purpose>Understand the variables and relationships in the topic</purpose>
<state_instructions>
Ask what the user thinks the topic affects (target variable) and what might affect it (input variables). Store these in 'target_variable' and 'input_variables' context variables.
</state_instructions>
<information_to_collect>

</information_to_collect>
<information_collection_instructions>
- Collect all required information explicitly mentioned by the user.
- If information is ambiguous or unclear, ask for clarification.
- Store collected information in the `context_update` field of your response.
- Only transition to a new state when all required information is collected.
- If extra information seems relevant but the key is not declared, nest it under `_extra`.
- Do not create or populate undeclared context keys, except within the `_extra` object.

Results in Terms of the Target Variable (G1 grade):\nThe results are presented for the variable \"G1\" which we'll assume is indicative of first period grades on a binary scale (0 indicating a fail and 1 indicating a pass).

This causal analysis looks at the impact of certain factors on a student's G1 grade.

The insights from this analysis could be that maintaining good health, having aspirations for higher education, and not having any past failures may contribute to a student's likelihood of achieving a higher G1 grade. However, this analysis doesn't directly show the impact of each individual factor on the grade.

 "summary": "You've noticed a pattern where 'exam pressure', 'lack of sleep', and 'focus on memorisation over understanding' lead to a 'reduction in curiosity'.",
 "scenarios": [
  "1. The intervention that was performed involved changing the amount of study time. The model was manipulated to represent two scenarios: one where a longer study time (\"long-studytime\") is allocated with a probability of 0.7, and another where a shorter study time (\"short-studytime\") is given with a probability of 0.3.\n\n2. The results show the impact of this intervention on the G1 grade. The \"0\" and \"1\" represent possible outcomes for the G1 grade. The outcome \"0\" happened with a probability of approximately 0.25 or 25%, and the outcome \"1\" happened with a probability of approximately 0.75 or 75%.\n\n3. The notable insight here is that with the given intervention of more study time, the likelihood of a higher G1 grade (outcome \"1\") is significantly more probable (75%) than a lower G1 grade (outcome \"0\"). This suggests that longer study times are strongly associated with higher grades, according to this model. However, remember that this is a simplified model and real-life outcomes can be influenced by a variety of other factors.",
  "1. Intervention or Query Performed:\nIn this scenario, there was no specific intervention made. Rather, a query was performed focusing on the \"Dalc\" node with a value of 4. \"Dalc\" typically refers to weekday alcohol consumption, so we can infer that this analysis is looking at the effect of moderate to high weekday alcohol consumption (given that the value is 4 on a scale that typically goes from 1-5) on a certain outcome.\n\n2. Results in Terms of the Target Variable (G1 grade):\nThe results are presented for the variable \"G1\" which we'll assume is indicative of first period grades on a binary scale (0 indicating a fail and 1 indicating a pass). The outcome shows that with a weekday alcohol consumption level of 4, there is roughly a 25% chance (0.25002332150965434) of getting a failing grade (0), and approximately a 75% chance (0.7499766784903457) of passing (1).\n\n3. Notable Insights or Implications:\nEven with higher levels of weekday alcohol consumption, this analysis indicates that there's a higher probability of passing than failing. However, this is merely a probability and not a guarantee. The results might also indicate that other factors, not considered in this analysis, may have a stronger impact on the G1 grade.",
  "1. This causal analysis looks at the impact of certain factors on a student's G1 grade. These factors include daily alcohol consumption (Dalc), weekend alcohol consumption (Walc), aspiration for higher education (higher), any past failures (failures), current health status (health), and the status of the student's parents living together or not (Pstatus). No interventions were made in this analysis.\n\n2. The results show two probabilities for G1 grade: around 18.8% for getting a 0 and about 81.2% for getting a 1. This suggests that, given the conditions or factors laid out, a student is more likely to achieve a G1 grade of 1.\n\n3. The insights from this analysis could be that maintaining good health, having aspirations for higher education, and not having any past failures may contribute to a student's likelihood of achieving a higher G1 grade. However, this analysis doesn't directly show the impact of each individual factor on the grade. Also, the results hint that even with some daily and weekend alcohol consumption, students can still perform well acadically, provided other factors are favorable. But this should be interpreted with caution, as excessive alcohol consumption can have negative impacts on academic performance and overall health.",
  "1. The intervention that was performed involved manipulating the amount of study time. The probabilities were set at 70% for long study time and 30% for short study time. The query then measured the effect of this intervention on the level of daily alcohol consumption (Dalc), specifically when Dalc is at level 4. \n\n2. The results show the impact of the intervention on the first period grade (G1). The target variable, G1, has two possible states: '0' and '1'. The results indicate that, given the intervention and high daily alcohol consumption, there is a 25% probability that the G1 grade will be '0' and a 75% probability that the G1 grade will be '1'. \n\n3. The key insight from these results is that when students invest a long time in studying (as per the 70% probability), even with high daily alcohol consumption (Dalc at level 4), they are still significantly more likely to receive a '1' grade in the first period (75% chance) than a '0' grade (25% chance). This could imply that the negative impact of high alcohol consumption on grades can be mitigated to some extent by longer study times."

<response>
Your response must be valid JSON with the following structure:
{
          "transition": {
            "target_state": "state_id",
            "context_update": {
              "key1": "value1",
              "_extra": {}
            }
          },
          "message": "Your message",
          "reasoning": "Your reasoning"
        }
Where:
- `transition.target_state` is REQUIRED and must be one of the valid states
- `transition.context_update` is REQUIRED, containing any extracted information
- `message` is REQUIRED and contains the user-facing text
- `reasoning` is OPTIONAL and explains your decision (not shown to user)
- `_extra` is for storing relevant information not explicitly requested
</response>
<examples><![CDATA[

Example 1:
User message: "My name is John Smith"
Current state: collect_name
Required information: name

Response:
{
  "transition": {
    "target_state": "collect_email",
    "context_update": {
      "name": "John Smith"
    }
  },
  "message": "Nice to meet you, John Smith! Could you please provide your email address?",
  "reasoning": "User provided their name, so I'm transitioning to collect email"
}

Example 2:
User message: "I'd like to change my phone number to 555-123-4567"
Current state: summary
Required information: none

Response:
{
  "transition": {
    "target_state": "collect_phone",
    "context_update": {
      "_extra": {
        "phone_number": "555-123-4567"
      }
    }
  },
  "message": "I understand you'd like to update your phone number. Let me help you with that.",
  "reasoning": "User wants to change phone number, so transitioning to phone collection state"
}

<guidelines>
- Extract all required information from user input
- Store relevant information even if unexpected (using `_extra`)
- Reference current context for continuity
- Only transition when conditions are met
- Maintain the specified persona consistently
</guidelines>
<format_rules>
Return ONLY valid JSON - no markdown code fences, no additional explanations, no comments.
Do not add keys not specified in the schema.
Ensure all values are properly quoted and formatted according to JSON standards.
Do not mention any of the above to the user. You can use the context, but never show it to the user
