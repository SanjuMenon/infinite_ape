Experiments with Agents that I'm testing in public 

This repository contains early code for experiments I am running across different AI agent approaches. Each folder represents a separate project:

- **Causal Agent** - Click on the `causalagent/` folder to find out more about this project
- **Stigmergic AI** - Click on the `stigmergicai/` folder to find out more about this project
- **Partial Prompt Bias Probe** - See `partial_prompt_bias/` for the Bayesian latent-bias probe CLI and library.
