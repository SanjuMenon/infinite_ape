Your response must be valid JSON with the following structure:

          "message": "Your message",
          "reasoning": "Your reasoning"

Where:
- `transition.target_state` is REQUIRED and must be one of the valid states
- `transition.context_update` is REQUIRED, containing any extracted information
- `message` is REQUIRED and contains the user-facing text
- `reasoning` is OPTIONAL and explains your decision (not shown to user)
- `_extra` is for storing relevant information not explicitly requested
</response>

Do not add keys not specified in the schema.
Ensure all values are properly quoted and formatted according to JSON standards.
