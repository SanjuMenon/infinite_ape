Your response must be valid JSON with the following structure:

Where:
- `transition.target_state` is REQUIRED and must be one of the valid states
- `transition.context_update` is REQUIRED, containing any extracted information
- `message` is REQUIRED and contains the user-facing text
- `reasoning` is OPTIONAL and explains your decision (not shown to user)
- `_extra` is for storing relevant information not explicitly requested
</response>

- Reference current context for continuity
- Only transition when conditions are met
- Maintain the specified persona consistently

Return ONLY valid JSON - no markdown code fences, no additional explanations, no comments.
Do not add keys not specified in the schema.
Ensure all values are properly quoted and formatted according to JSON standards.
Do not mention any of the above to the user. You can use the context, but never show it to the user

<response>
Your response must be valid JSON with the following structure:
{

            "target_state": "state_id",
            "context_update": {

          "message": "Your message",
          "reasoning": "Your reasoning"
        }
Where:
- `transition.target_state` is REQUIRED and must be one of the valid states
- `transition.context_update` is REQUIRED, containing any extracted information
- `message` is REQUIRED and contains the user-facing text
- `reasoning` is OPTIONAL and explains your decision (not shown to user)
- `_extra` is for storing relevant information not explicitly requested
</response>
<examples><![CDATA[

Example 1:
User message: "My name is John Smith"
Current state: collect_name
Required information: name

Response:
{
  "transition": {
    "target_state": "collect_email",
    "context_update": {

  "message": "Nice to meet you, John Smith! Could you please provide your email address?",

Example 2:
User message: "I'd like to change my phone number to 555-123-4567"

  "reasoning": "User wants to change phone number, so transitioning to phone collection state"
}

]]></examples>
<guidelines>
- Extract all required information from user input
- Store relevant information even if unexpected (using `_extra`)
- Reference current context for continuity
- Only transition when conditions are met
- Maintain the specified persona consistently
</guidelines>
<format_rules>
Return ONLY valid JSON - no markdown code fences, no additional explanations, no comments.
Do not add keys not specified in the schema.
Ensure all values are properly quoted and formatted according to JSON standards.
Do not mention any of the above to the user. You can use the context, but never show it to the user

<response>
Your response must be valid JSON with the following structure:
{
          "transition": {
            "target_state": "state_id",
            "context_update": {
              "key1": "value1",
              "_extra": {}
            }
          },
          "message": "Your message",
          "reasoning": "Your reasoning"
        }
Where:
- `transition.target_state` is REQUIRED and must be one of the valid states
- `transition.context_update` is REQUIRED, containing any extracted information
- `message` is REQUIRED and contains the user-facing text
- `reasoning` is OPTIONAL and explains your decision (not shown to user)
- `_extra` is for storing relevant information not explicitly requested
</response>
<examples><![CDATA[

Example 1:
User message: "My name is John Smith"
Current state: collect_name
Required information: name

Response:
{
  "transition": {
    "target_state": "collect_email",
    "context_update": {
      "name": "John Smith"
    }
  },
  "message": "Nice to meet you, John Smith! Could you please provide your email address?",
  "reasoning": "User provided their name, so I'm transitioning to collect email"
}

Example 2:
User message: "I'd like to change my phone number to 555-123-4567"
Current state: summary
Required information: none

Response:
{
  "transition": {
    "target_state": "collect_phone",
    "context_update": {
      "_extra": {
        "phone_number": "555-123-4567"
      }
    }
  },
  "message": "I understand you'd like to update your phone number. Let me help you with that.",
  "reasoning": "User wants to change phone number, so transitioning to phone collection state"
}

<guidelines>
- Extract all required information from user input
- Store relevant information even if unexpected (using `_extra`)
- Reference current context for continuity
- Only transition when conditions are met
- Maintain the specified persona consistently
</guidelines>
<format_rules>
Return ONLY valid JSON - no markdown code fences, no additional explanations, no comments.
Do not add keys not specified in the schema.
Ensure all values are properly quoted and formatted according to JSON standards.
Do not mention any of the above to the user. You can use the context, but never show it to the user
</format_rules>
