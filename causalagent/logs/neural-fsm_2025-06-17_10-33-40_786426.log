The intervention that was performed involved a change in the 'studytime' variable. The intervention was conducted to observe the effect of two different study durations, 'long-studytime' and 'short-studytime', on the outcome.

The results of this intervention are represented in terms of the target variable, which is 'G1 grade'. The results show two possible outcomes, '0' and '1'. An outcome of '0' occurred with a probability of approximately 25%, while an outcome of '1' occurred with a higher probability of roughly 75%.\n\n3. These results suggest that the intervention, particularly increasing the study time (the 'long-studytime' scenario), has a significant impact on achieving a positive outcome (represented by '1') for the G1 grade. This implies that longer study times are likely to result in better G1 grades, as the probability of achieving a '1' outcome is notably higher (roughly 75%) under this intervention.

Analysis of Results:\nThe results indicate the probabilities of the \"G1\" grade (which could be a student's grade) falling into two categories, \"0\" and \"1\". When the \"Dalc\" value is 3, there is approximately a 25% chance (0.2500070350223799) that the \"G1\" grade will be 0, and about a 75% chance (0.74999296497762) that the \"G1\" grade will be 1.

Notable Insights:\nThis data could suggest a relationship between the level of daily alcohol consumption (Dalc) and a student's grades.

  "1. The intervention that was performed involved a change in the 'studytime' variable. The intervention was conducted to observe the effect of two different study durations, 'long-studytime' and 'short-studytime', on the outcome. In this scenario, the probabilities set for these variables were 70% for 'long-studytime' and 30% for 'short-studytime'.\n\n2. The results of this intervention are represented in terms of the target variable, which is 'G1 grade'. The results show two possible outcomes, '0' and '1'. An outcome of '0' occurred with a probability of approximately 25%, while an outcome of '1' occurred with a higher probability of roughly 75%.\n\n3. These results suggest that the intervention, particularly increasing the study time (the 'long-studytime' scenario), has a significant impact on achieving a positive outcome (represented by '1') for the G1 grade. This implies that longer study times are likely to result in better G1 grades, as the probability of achieving a '1' outcome is notably higher (roughly 75%) under this intervention. However, since there are only two possible outcomes in this analysis ('0' and '1'), it's also important to note that even with longer study times, there's still a 25% chance of not achieving a positive outcome.",
  "1. Query Performed:\nIn this scenario, a query was performed on the \"Dalc\" node with a value of 3. This means that we are looking at a situation where the \"Dalc\" (which could represent a variable like 'Daily Alcohol Consumption') is set at a certain level, in this case, 3.\n\n2. Analysis of Results:\nThe results indicate the probabilities of the \"G1\" grade (which could be a student's grade) falling into two categories, \"0\" and \"1\". When the \"Dalc\" value is 3, there is approximately a 25% chance (0.2500070350223799) that the \"G1\" grade will be 0, and about a 75% chance (0.74999296497762) that the \"G1\" grade will be 1. In other words, given a \"Dalc\" value of 3, a student is three times more likely to get a \"G1\" grade of 1 than a grade of 0.\n\n3. Notable Insights:\nThis data could suggest a relationship between the level of daily alcohol consumption (Dalc) and a student's grades. Specifically, a higher level of Dalc (in this case, 3) is more likely to correspond with a higher \"G1\" grade (1). However, it's important to note that this is a probabilistic result and does not guarantee that higher daily alcohol consumption will always lead to a higher grade. Other factors not considered in this model may also influence the student's grade.",
  "1. Intervention or Query Performed:\nAn intervention was performed on the variable \"studytime\". Two scenarios were considered: a longer study time and a shorter study time. The probability of having a long study time was set to 0.7, and the probability of having a short study time was set to 0.3.\n\nA query was then performed on the variable \"Dalc\", with the value set to 3. This represents the consumption of alcohol on workdays.\n\n2. The Results in Terms of the Target Variable (G1 grade):\nThe results of the analysis are given in terms of the G1 grade, which can either be 0 or 1. The probability of getting a grade of 0 (likely representing a poor grade) is about 0.25 (or 25%). On the other hand, the probability of getting a grade of 1 (likely representing a good grade) is about 0.75 (or 75%).\n\n3. Notable Insights or Implications:\nThe results suggest that, given the conditions of this intervention (long study time with a probability of 0.7 and short study time with a probability of 0.3, along with a moderate level of workday alcohol consumption), the likelihood of getting a good grade (1) is three times higher than that of getting a poor grade (0). \n\nIt's important to remember these probabilities do not guarantee any specific outcome for an individual, they only give an indication of the likelihood of such outcomes across a large number of similar scenarios."

The intervention that was performed involved a change in the 'studytime' variable. The intervention was conducted to observe the effect of two different study durations, 'long-studytime' and 'short-studytime', on the outcome. In this scenario, the probabilities set for these variables were 70% for 'long-studytime' and 30% for 'short-studytime'.\n\n2. The results of this intervention are represented in terms of the target variable, which is 'G1 grade'. The results show two possible outcomes, '0' and '1'. An outcome of '0' occurred with a probability of approximately 25%, while an outcome of '1' occurred with a higher probability of roughly 75%.\n\n3. These results suggest that the intervention, particularly increasing the study time (the 'long-studytime' scenario), has a significant impact on achieving a positive outcome (represented by '1') for the G1 grade. This implies that longer study times are likely to result in better G1 grades, as the probability of achieving a '1' outcome is notably higher (roughly 75%) under this intervention. However, since there are only two possible outcomes in this analysis ('0' and '1'), it's also important to note that even with longer study times, there's still a 25% chance of not achieving a positive outcome.", "1. Query Performed:\nIn this scenario, a query was performed on the \"Dalc\" node with a value of 3. This means that we are looking at a situation where the \"Dalc\" (which could represent a variable like 'Daily Alcohol Consumption') is set at a certain level, in this case, 3.\n\n2. Analysis of Results:\nThe results indicate the probabilities of the \"G1\" grade (which could be a student's grade) falling into two categories, \"0\" and \"1\". When the \"Dalc\" value is 3, there is approximately a 25% chance (0.2500070350223799) that the \"G1\" grade will be 0, and about a 75% chance (0.74999296497762) that the \"G1\" grade will be 1. In other words, given a \"Dalc\" value of 3, a student is three times more likely to get a \"G1\" grade of 1 than a grade of 0.\n\n3. Notable Insights:\nThis data could suggest a relationship between the level of daily alcohol consumption (Dalc) and a student's grades. Specifically, a higher level of Dalc (in this case, 3) is more likely to correspond with a higher \"G1\" grade (1). However, it's important to note that this is a probabilistic result and does not guarantee that higher daily alcohol consumption will always lead to a higher grade. Other factors not considered in this model may also influence the student's grade.", "1. Intervention or Query Performed:\nAn intervention was performed on the variable \"studytime\". Two scenarios were considered: a longer study time and a shorter study time. The probability of having a long study time was set to 0.7, and the probability of having a short study time was set to 0.3.\n\nA query was then performed on the variable \"Dalc\", with the value set to 3. This represents the consumption of alcohol on workdays.\n\n2. The Results in Terms of the Target Variable (G1 grade):\nThe results of the analysis are given in terms of the G1 grade, which can either be 0 or 1. The probability of getting a grade of 0 (likely representing a poor grade) is about 0.25 (or 25%). On the other hand, the probability of getting a grade of 1 (likely representing a good grade) is about 0.75 (or 75%).\n\n3. Notable Insights or Implications:\nThe results suggest that, given the conditions of this intervention (long study time with a probability of 0.7 and short study time with a probability of 0.3, along with a moderate level of workday alcohol consumption), the likelihood of getting a good grade (1) is three times higher than that of getting a poor grade (0). \n\nIt's important to remember these probabilities do not guarantee any specific outcome for an individual, they only give an indication of the likelihood of such outcomes across a large number of similar scenarios."], "system": {"handlers": {"CONTEXT_UPDATE": [{"name": "CausalResponseGenerator", "updated_keys": ["scenarios"]}]}}}

The intervention that was performed involved a change in the 'studytime' variable. The intervention was conducted to observe the effect of two different study durations, 'long-studytime' and 'short-studytime', on the outcome. In this scenario, the probabilities set for these variables were 70% for 'long-studytime' and 30% for 'short-studytime'.\n\n2. The results of this intervention are represented in terms of the target variable, which is 'G1 grade'. The results show two possible outcomes, '0' and '1'. An outcome of '0' occurred with a probability of approximately 25%, while an outcome of '1' occurred with a higher probability of roughly 75%.\n\n3. These results suggest that the intervention, particularly increasing the study time (the 'long-studytime' scenario), has a significant impact on achieving a positive outcome (represented by '1') for the G1 grade. This implies that longer study times are likely to result in better G1 grades, as the probability of achieving a '1' outcome is notably higher (roughly 75%) under this intervention. However, since there are only two possible outcomes in this analysis ('0' and '1'), it's also important to note that even with longer study times, there's still a 25% chance of not achieving a positive outcome.", "1. Query Performed:\nIn this scenario, a query was performed on the \"Dalc\" node with a value of 3. This means that we are looking at a situation where the \"Dalc\" (which could represent a variable like 'Daily Alcohol Consumption') is set at a certain level, in this case, 3.\n\n2. Analysis of Results:\nThe results indicate the probabilities of the \"G1\" grade (which could be a student's grade) falling into two categories, \"0\" and \"1\". When the \"Dalc\" value is 3, there is approximately a 25% chance (0.2500070350223799) that the \"G1\" grade will be 0, and about a 75% chance (0.74999296497762) that the \"G1\" grade will be 1. In other words, given a \"Dalc\" value of 3, a student is three times more likely to get a \"G1\" grade of 1 than a grade of 0.\n\n3. Notable Insights:\nThis data could suggest a relationship between the level of daily alcohol consumption (Dalc) and a student's grades. Specifically, a higher level of Dalc (in this case, 3) is more likely to correspond with a higher \"G1\" grade (1). However, it's important to note that this is a probabilistic result and does not guarantee that higher daily alcohol consumption will always lead to a higher grade. Other factors not considered in this model may also influence the student's grade.", "1. Intervention or Query Performed:\nAn intervention was performed on the variable \"studytime\". Two scenarios were considered: a longer study time and a shorter study time. The probability of having a long study time was set to 0.7, and the probability of having a short study time was set to 0.3.\n\nA query was then performed on the variable \"Dalc\", with the value set to 3. This represents the consumption of alcohol on workdays.\n\n2. The Results in Terms of the Target Variable (G1 grade):\nThe results of the analysis are given in terms of the G1 grade, which can either be 0 or 1. The probability of getting a grade of 0 (likely representing a poor grade) is about 0.25 (or 25%). On the other hand, the probability of getting a grade of 1 (likely representing a good grade) is about 0.75 (or 75%).\n\n3. Notable Insights or Implications:\nThe results suggest that, given the conditions of this intervention (long study time with a probability of 0.7 and short study time with a probability of 0.3, along with a moderate level of workday alcohol consumption), the likelihood of getting a good grade (1) is three times higher than that of getting a poor grade (0). \n\nIt's important to remember these probabilities do not guarantee any specific outcome for an individual, they only give an indication of the likelihood of such outcomes across a large number of similar scenarios."], "system": {"handlers": {"CONTEXT_UPDATE": [{"name": "CausalResponseGenerator", "updated_keys": ["scenarios"]}]}}}

The intervention that was performed involved a change in the 'studytime' variable. The intervention was conducted to observe the effect of two different study durations, 'long-studytime' and 'short-studytime', on the outcome. In this scenario, the probabilities set for these variables were 70% for 'long-studytime' and 30% for 'short-studytime'.\n\n2. The results of this intervention are represented in terms of the target variable, which is 'G1 grade'. The results show two possible outcomes, '0' and '1'. An outcome of '0' occurred with a probability of approximately 25%, while an outcome of '1' occurred with a higher probability of roughly 75%.\n\n3. These results suggest that the intervention, particularly increasing the study time (the 'long-studytime' scenario), has a significant impact on achieving a positive outcome (represented by '1') for the G1 grade. This implies that longer study times are likely to result in better G1 grades, as the probability of achieving a '1' outcome is notably higher (roughly 75%) under this intervention. However, since there are only two possible outcomes in this analysis ('0' and '1'), it's also important to note that even with longer study times, there's still a 25% chance of not achieving a positive outcome.", "1. Query Performed:\nIn this scenario, a query was performed on the \"Dalc\" node with a value of 3. This means that we are looking at a situation where the \"Dalc\" (which could represent a variable like 'Daily Alcohol Consumption') is set at a certain level, in this case, 3.\n\n2. Analysis of Results:\nThe results indicate the probabilities of the \"G1\" grade (which could be a student's grade) falling into two categories, \"0\" and \"1\". When the \"Dalc\" value is 3, there is approximately a 25% chance (0.2500070350223799) that the \"G1\" grade will be 0, and about a 75% chance (0.74999296497762) that the \"G1\" grade will be 1. In other words, given a \"Dalc\" value of 3, a student is three times more likely to get a \"G1\" grade of 1 than a grade of 0.\n\n3. Notable Insights:\nThis data could suggest a relationship between the level of daily alcohol consumption (Dalc) and a student's grades. Specifically, a higher level of Dalc (in this case, 3) is more likely to correspond with a higher \"G1\" grade (1). However, it's important to note that this is a probabilistic result and does not guarantee that higher daily alcohol consumption will always lead to a higher grade. Other factors not considered in this model may also influence the student's grade.", "1. Intervention or Query Performed:\nAn intervention was performed on the variable \"studytime\". Two scenarios were considered: a longer study time and a shorter study time. The probability of having a long study time was set to 0.7, and the probability of having a short study time was set to 0.3.\n\nA query was then performed on the variable \"Dalc\", with the value set to 3. This represents the consumption of alcohol on workdays.\n\n2. The Results in Terms of the Target Variable (G1 grade):\nThe results of the analysis are given in terms of the G1 grade, which can either be 0 or 1. The probability of getting a grade of 0 (likely representing a poor grade) is about 0.25 (or 25%). On the other hand, the probability of getting a grade of 1 (likely representing a good grade) is about 0.75 (or 75%).\n\n3. Notable Insights or Implications:\nThe results suggest that, given the conditions of this intervention (long study time with a probability of 0.7 and short study time with a probability of 0.3, along with a moderate level of workday alcohol consumption), the likelihood of getting a good grade (1) is three times higher than that of getting a poor grade (0). \n\nIt's important to remember these probabilities do not guarantee any specific outcome for an individual, they only give an indication of the likelihood of such outcomes across a large number of similar scenarios."], "system": {"handlers": {"CONTEXT_UPDATE": [{"name": "CausalResponseGenerator", "updated_keys": ["scenarios"]}]}}}

  "1. The intervention that was performed involved a change in the 'studytime' variable. The intervention was conducted to observe the effect of two different study durations, 'long-studytime' and 'short-studytime', on the outcome. In this scenario, the probabilities set for these variables were 70% for 'long-studytime' and 30% for 'short-studytime'.\n\n2. The results of this intervention are represented in terms of the target variable, which is 'G1 grade'. The results show two possible outcomes, '0' and '1'. An outcome of '0' occurred with a probability of approximately 25%, while an outcome of '1' occurred with a higher probability of roughly 75%.\n\n3. These results suggest that the intervention, particularly increasing the study time (the 'long-studytime' scenario), has a significant impact on achieving a positive outcome (represented by '1') for the G1 grade. This implies that longer study times are likely to result in better G1 grades, as the probability of achieving a '1' outcome is notably higher (roughly 75%) under this intervention. However, since there are only two possible outcomes in this analysis ('0' and '1'), it's also important to note that even with longer study times, there's still a 25% chance of not achieving a positive outcome.",
  "1. Query Performed:\nIn this scenario, a query was performed on the \"Dalc\" node with a value of 3. This means that we are looking at a situation where the \"Dalc\" (which could represent a variable like 'Daily Alcohol Consumption') is set at a certain level, in this case, 3.\n\n2. Analysis of Results:\nThe results indicate the probabilities of the \"G1\" grade (which could be a student's grade) falling into two categories, \"0\" and \"1\". When the \"Dalc\" value is 3, there is approximately a 25% chance (0.2500070350223799) that the \"G1\" grade will be 0, and about a 75% chance (0.74999296497762) that the \"G1\" grade will be 1. In other words, given a \"Dalc\" value of 3, a student is three times more likely to get a \"G1\" grade of 1 than a grade of 0.\n\n3. Notable Insights:\nThis data could suggest a relationship between the level of daily alcohol consumption (Dalc) and a student's grades. Specifically, a higher level of Dalc (in this case, 3) is more likely to correspond with a higher \"G1\" grade (1). However, it's important to note that this is a probabilistic result and does not guarantee that higher daily alcohol consumption will always lead to a higher grade. Other factors not considered in this model may also influence the student's grade.",
  "1. Intervention or Query Performed:\nAn intervention was performed on the variable \"studytime\". Two scenarios were considered: a longer study time and a shorter study time. The probability of having a long study time was set to 0.7, and the probability of having a short study time was set to 0.3.\n\nA query was then performed on the variable \"Dalc\", with the value set to 3. This represents the consumption of alcohol on workdays.\n\n2. The Results in Terms of the Target Variable (G1 grade):\nThe results of the analysis are given in terms of the G1 grade, which can either be 0 or 1. The probability of getting a grade of 0 (likely representing a poor grade) is about 0.25 (or 25%). On the other hand, the probability of getting a grade of 1 (likely representing a good grade) is about 0.75 (or 75%).\n\n3. Notable Insights or Implications:\nThe results suggest that, given the conditions of this intervention (long study time with a probability of 0.7 and short study time with a probability of 0.3, along with a moderate level of workday alcohol consumption), the likelihood of getting a good grade (1) is three times higher than that of getting a poor grade (0). \n\nIt's important to remember these probabilities do not guarantee any specific outcome for an individual, they only give an indication of the likelihood of such outcomes across a large number of similar scenarios."

<response>
Your response must be valid JSON with the following structure:
{
          "transition": {
            "target_state": "state_id",
            "context_update": {
              "key1": "value1",
              "_extra": {}
            }
          },
          "message": "Your message",
          "reasoning": "Your reasoning"
        }
Where:
- `transition.target_state` is REQUIRED and must be one of the valid states
- `transition.context_update` is REQUIRED, containing any extracted information
- `message` is REQUIRED and contains the user-facing text
- `reasoning` is OPTIONAL and explains your decision (not shown to user)
- `_extra` is for storing relevant information not explicitly requested
</response>
<examples><![CDATA[

Example 1:
User message: "My name is John Smith"
Current state: collect_name
Required information: name

Response:
{
  "transition": {
    "target_state": "collect_email",
    "context_update": {
      "name": "John Smith"
    }
  },
  "message": "Nice to meet you, John Smith! Could you please provide your email address?",
  "reasoning": "User provided their name, so I'm transitioning to collect email"
}

Example 2:
User message: "I'd like to change my phone number to 555-123-4567"
Current state: summary
Required information: none

Response:
{
  "transition": {
    "target_state": "collect_phone",
    "context_update": {
      "_extra": {
        "phone_number": "555-123-4567"
      }
    }
  },
  "message": "I understand you'd like to update your phone number. Let me help you with that.",
  "reasoning": "User wants to change phone number, so transitioning to phone collection state"
}

<guidelines>
- Extract all required information from user input
- Store relevant information even if unexpected (using `_extra`)
- Reference current context for continuity
- Only transition when conditions are met
- Maintain the specified persona consistently
</guidelines>
<format_rules>
Return ONLY valid JSON - no markdown code fences, no additional explanations, no comments.
Do not add keys not specified in the schema.
Ensure all values are properly quoted and formatted according to JSON standards.
Do not mention any of the above to the user. You can use the context, but never show it to the user
