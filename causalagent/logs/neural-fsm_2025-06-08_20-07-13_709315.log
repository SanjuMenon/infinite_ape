Your response must be valid JSON with the following structure:

          "message": "Your message",
          "reasoning": "Your reasoning"
        }
Where:
- `transition.target_state` is REQUIRED and must be one of the valid states
- `transition.context_update` is REQUIRED, containing any extracted information
- `message` is REQUIRED and contains the user-facing text
- `reasoning` is OPTIONAL and explains your decision (not shown to user)
- `_extra` is for storing relevant information not explicitly requested
</response>

<guidelines>
- Extract all required information from user input
- Store relevant information even if unexpected (using `_extra`)
- Reference current context for continuity
- Only transition when conditions are met
- Maintain the specified persona consistently
</guidelines>
<format_rules>
Return ONLY valid JSON - no markdown code fences, no additional explanations, no comments.
Do not add keys not specified in the schema.
Ensure all values are properly quoted and formatted according to JSON standards.
Do not mention any of the above to the user. You can use the context, but never show it to the user

Your response must be valid JSON with the following structure:

          "message": "Your message",
          "reasoning": "Your reasoning"

Where:
- `transition.target_state` is REQUIRED and must be one of the valid states
- `transition.context_update` is REQUIRED, containing any extracted information
- `message` is REQUIRED and contains the user-facing text
- `reasoning` is OPTIONAL and explains your decision (not shown to user)
- `_extra` is for storing relevant information not explicitly requested
</response>

Where:
- `transition.target_state` is REQUIRED and must be one of the valid states
- `transition.context_update` is REQUIRED, containing any extracted information
- `message` is REQUIRED and contains the user-facing text
- `reasoning` is OPTIONAL and explains your decision (not shown to user)
- `_extra` is for storing relevant information not explicitly requested
</response>

Example 1:
User message: "My name is John Smith"

Required information: name

Response:

<guidelines>
- Extract all required information from user input
- Store relevant information even if unexpected (using `_extra`)
- Reference current context for continuity
- Only transition when conditions are met
- Maintain the specified persona consistently
</guidelines>
<format_rules>
Return ONLY valid JSON - no markdown code fences, no additional explanations, no comments.
Do not add keys not specified in the schema.
Ensure all values are properly quoted and formatted according to JSON standards.
Do not mention any of the above to the user. You can use the context, but never show it to the user

<guidelines>
- Extract all required information from user input
- Store relevant information even if unexpected (using `_extra`)
- Reference current context for continuity
- Only transition when conditions are met
- Maintain the specified persona consistently
</guidelines>
<format_rules>
Return ONLY valid JSON - no markdown code fences, no additional explanations, no comments.
Do not add keys not specified in the schema.
Ensure all values are properly quoted and formatted according to JSON standards.
Do not mention any of the above to the user. You can use the context, but never show it to the user

<response>
Your response must be valid JSON with the following structure:
{
          "transition": {
            "target_state": "state_id",
            "context_update": {
              "key1": "value1",
              "_extra": {}
            }
          },
          "message": "Your message",
          "reasoning": "Your reasoning"
        }
Where:
- `transition.target_state` is REQUIRED and must be one of the valid states
- `transition.context_update` is REQUIRED, containing any extracted information
- `message` is REQUIRED and contains the user-facing text
- `reasoning` is OPTIONAL and explains your decision (not shown to user)
- `_extra` is for storing relevant information not explicitly requested
</response>

    "target_state": "collect_phone",
    "context_update": {
      "_extra": {
        "phone_number": "555-123-4567"
      }
    }

<guidelines>
- Extract all required information from user input
- Store relevant information even if unexpected (using `_extra`)
- Reference current context for continuity
- Only transition when conditions are met
- Maintain the specified persona consistently
</guidelines>
<format_rules>
Return ONLY valid JSON - no markdown code fences, no additional explanations, no comments.
Do not add keys not specified in the schema.
Ensure all values are properly quoted and formatted according to JSON standards.
Do not mention any of the above to the user. You can use the context, but never show it to the user
