Your response must be valid JSON with the following structure:

Where:
- `transition.target_state` is REQUIRED and must be one of the valid states
- `transition.context_update` is REQUIRED, containing any extracted information
- `message` is REQUIRED and contains the user-facing text
- `reasoning` is OPTIONAL and explains your decision (not shown to user)
- `_extra` is for storing relevant information not explicitly requested
</response>

Do not add keys not specified in the schema.
Ensure all values are properly quoted and formatted according to JSON standards.

<task>
You are the Natural Language Understanding component in a Finite State Machine (FSM) based conversational system.
Your responsibilities:
- Process user input based on current state (<current_state>)
- Collect required information from input to `context_update`
- Select appropriate transitions from <transitions>
- Generate messages based on the instructions
- Follow the <response> instructions to generate valid JSON output

- Collect all required information explicitly mentioned by the user.

- Store collected information in the `context_update` field of your response.
- Only transition to a new state when all required information is collected.
- If extra information seems relevant but the key is not declared, nest it under `_extra`.
- Do not create or populate undeclared context keys, except within the `_extra` object.

Your response must be valid JSON with the following structure:

Where:
- `transition.target_state` is REQUIRED and must be one of the valid states
- `transition.context_update` is REQUIRED, containing any extracted information
- `message` is REQUIRED and contains the user-facing text
- `reasoning` is OPTIONAL and explains your decision (not shown to user)
- `_extra` is for storing relevant information not explicitly requested
</response>

- Extract all required information from user input
- Store relevant information even if unexpected (using `_extra`)
- Reference current context for continuity
- Only transition when conditions are met
- Maintain the specified persona consistently
</guidelines>
<format_rules>
Return ONLY valid JSON - no markdown code fences, no additional explanations, no comments.
Do not add keys not specified in the schema.
Ensure all values are properly quoted and formatted according to JSON standards.
Do not mention any of the above to the user. You can use the context, but never show it to the user

Intervention Performed:\nThe intervention performed involved manipulating the amount of study time. The study time was divided into two categories: long study time and short study time. Both of these categories were given equal probability, meaning that there was a 50% chance of a student having a long study time and a 50% chance of them having a short study time.\n\n2. Explanation of Results:\nThe results are in reference to the target variable, which is the G1 grade. The G1 grade is split into two categories: \"0\" and \"1\". The results show that with the given intervention (equal probability of long and short study times), there is approximately a 25% chance that a student will fall into the \"0\" category of G1 grade and approximately a 75% chance that they will fall into the \"1\" category.\n\n3. Notable Insights and Implications:\nThis analysis suggests a strong relationship between study time and G1 grade. Despite the equal probabilities of long and short study times, the results lean more towards the \"1\" category for G1 grade. This could imply that even a short amount of study time can have a significant positive impact on a student's G1 grade. However, to make more accurate conclusions, further details about how the grades \"0\" and \"1\" are defined and the exact differences between long and short study times are needed.", "1. The intervention or query performed was a check to see what the results would be if the \"Dalc\" variable was set to 3. This variable likely represents some kind of condition or factor, which was artificially adjusted to this specific value for the purpose of the analysis.\n\n2. The results of this intervention are expressed in terms of the target variable, which is a grade represented by \"G1\". The values given indicate the probabilities for different outcomes. A \"0\" grade has a probability of approximately 0.25, or 25%, while a \"1\" grade has a probability of approximately 0.75, or 75%. In simple terms, if the condition represented by \"Dalc\" is set to 3, there's a 75% chance of getting a \"1\" grade and a 25% chance of getting a \"0\" grade.\n\n3. The main insight here is that the \"Dalc\" condition strongly influences the \"G1\" grade. When \"Dalc\" is set to 3, it's much more likely that the grade will be \"1\" rather than \"0\". This could have various implications depending on the specific context, but generally, it suggests that this factor is important to consider when trying to predict or influence the \"G1\" grade.", "1. The intervention or query that was performed was not an intervention but an observation of specific characteristics in the scenario. It was evaluating the effect of these characteristics or variables on the G1 grade. The variables used in this scenario included: Dalc (Daily alcohol consumption) that was set to a value of 3, goout (Going out with friends) with a value of 2, freetime (Free time after school) with a value of 5, romantic (In a romantic relationship) set to \"yes\", and Pstatus (Parent's cohabitation status) set to \"A\".\n\n2. In terms of the target variable, which is the G1 grade, the results show two possible outcomes, \"0\" and \"1\". The values next to these outcomes represent the probability of each outcome occurring given the input scenario. The probability that the G1 grade is \"0\" is approximately 0.25 (or 25%), while the probability that the G1 grade is \"1\" is approximately 0.75 (or 75%). This means that, given the variables in the scenario, the subject is more likely to achieve a G1 grade of \"1\".\n\n3. The implications of these results are that the given variables - daily alcohol consumption, going out with friends, free time after school, being in a romantic relationship, and parent's cohabitation status - might have a significant influence on a student's G1 grade. Specifically, these variables, as they are in the scenario, are more likely to result in a G1 grade of \"1\". However, it's important to remember that correlation doesn't necessarily imply causation, so further research would be needed to fully understand how and if these variables directly affect a student's grade.", "1. Intervention or Query Performed:\nThe analysis conducted an intervention on the variable \"studytime\" and set it to two possible states: \"long-studytime\" and \"short-studytime\", each with an equal probability of 0.5. This means the studytime was equally split between being long and short. The analysis then queried the effect of this intervention on the value 3 of the variable \"Dalc\" (Daily Alcohol Consumption).\n\n2. Results in Terms of the Target Variable (G1 grade):\nThe results are in relation to the variable \"G1\" which appears to be a grade. The numbers \"0\" and \"1\" are the possible states of G1 grade, perhaps indicating pass/fail or some other binary outcome. The analysis shows that with the given intervention and query, there is a 25% chance of the G1 grade being in state \"0\" and a 75% chance of it being in state \"1\". \n\n3. Notable Insights or Implications:\nThe results suggest that regardless of whether study time is long or short, if the daily alcohol consumption is at level 3, there is a higher likelihood (75%) of obtaining the state \"1\" for G1 grade. This could imply that this level of alcohol consumption doesn't necessarily negatively impact the G1 grade, given that state \"1\" could represent a passing grade or a more positive outcome.
