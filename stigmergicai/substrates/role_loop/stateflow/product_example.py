FSM Stacking Example: Product Recommendation System

This example demonstrates advanced FSM stacking capabilities with a real-world
product recommendation scenario. It shows how to:

1. Start with a main customer service FSM
2. Stack a specialized product recommendation FSM when needed
3. Handle context inheritance and return
4. Use different merge strategies for context handover
5. Preserve conversation history across FSM transitions

The scenario involves a customer service bot that can delegate to a specialized
product recommendation system when the customer needs product suggestions.
